      "The venue itself has been on a bit of a journeyƒ?İ",
      "The story of The Old Timber Store began back in the 1800s when horse and carriage would trot through the railway arches, a construction wonder of the world at the time. Since the 1990s, the magnificent brick viaducts have hosted LASSCO's flooring yard. A sensitive renovation to keep the essence of the space alive has now transformed the arch into a unique space to host intimate wedding ceremonies, with a 60 person capacity."

      "Get whisked away from the bustle of the big smoke and experience a world where old London meets new beginningsƒ?İ",
      "The Old Timber Store is a historic railway arch nestled in the home of Bermondsey's best-kept secret: Maltby Street Market. The cobbles of the ropewalk are host to weekly street food fusions from all over this wonderful world, but this dedicated arch now offers some respite from the urban hustle and bustle, with a magical backdrop.",
      "This picturesque railway arch combines the tranquillity of nature with the industrial essence of 19th-century London. A rustic setting adorned with splendid seasonal florals, where wooden beams provide a perfect canvas for your special day."
